# Server_Availability
To Verify if the server is running is or not using Host name or IP Address

When you run the code, if the server you are trying to breach is down then the user will be asked to enter the Username and password for gamil and also email ID of the person whom they want to send this email to. We can hard code the primary user credentials if we want by modifying the email_id and password values in the code.
